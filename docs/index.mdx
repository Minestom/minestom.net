# Presentation

The goal of this wiki is to familiarize you with our library. The most important concepts are described here, however many are not. You can contact one of the Minestom contributors if you wish to help develop the library or have any questions.

The project Javadoc is currently hosted [here](https://minestom.github.io/Minestom/). Additionally, we do have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pkFRvqB) where you can ask anything you want.

If you do not know how you landed here, Minestom is a complete rewrite of the Minecraft server software without any Mojang code. You can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom).
