  This page describes how to load a world folder using AnvilLoader
---

## Loading a world using AnvilLoader

In order to load a world into an instance, use the `InstanceContainer#setChunkLoader(IChunkLoader)` function.

An example of using this method to load a world is:
```java
InstanceContainer.setChunkLoader(new AnvilLoader("worlds/world"));
```

This will load the world inside of the `worlds/world` directory into the InstanceContainer, allowing you to use the instance as before but having the world loaded inside.

In order to load a world, the world folder will only need the `/region` folder, as it contains the block data.

## Saving a world

In order to save a world, you will have to use the `InstanceContainer#saveChunksToStorage()` function, 
this will only work if you have previously loaded a world into the instance using AnvilLoader.
