# Welcome to [Minestom]{.minestom-gradient-text}

---

The goal of this wiki is to familiarize you with our library. The most important concepts are described here, however many are not. You can contact one of the Minestom contributors if you wish to help develop the library or have questions.

In addition to the wiki, we highly recommend checking out our [Javadocs](https://javadoc.minestom.net) and joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/pkFRvqB).

If you do not know how you landed here, Minestom is a complete rewrite of the Minecraft server software without any Mojang code. You can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom).

:::alert note
While we try to update the wiki as things change, it is not always up to date. If you see something out of date or incorrect, we are always open to pull requests!
