# Libraries

Libraries can be used to share code between multiple projects.
Here you can find public libraries, official ones are highlighted with orange; work-in-progress libraries are opaque.

Note that the WIP state is determined automatically based on releases, if your library is production ready be sure to create a release for it.

To submit your library, simply add the minestom-library topic to your repository on GitHub.
