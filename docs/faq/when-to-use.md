# When should I use Minestom?

---

As Minecraft has evolved, many servers struggle to keep up with new features and work around outdated legacy systems. Minestom addresses this by offering a clean, minimal starting point, enabling you to take full control of how your server functions.

In practical terms, this means that Minestom doesn’t include built-in vanilla behavior for things like chests, commands, or combat—you have to implement them all yourself. While this might seem like extra work at first, the benefit is a highly customizable and efficient server where you can implement only the features you need, and nothing else.

Minestom is the ideal choice for situations where flexibility and performance are more important than maintaining the out-of-the-box "vanilla" Minecraft experience. 

In short, use Minestom when you:
- **Need a lightweight, high-performance server** – Minestom is designed for efficiency, making it ideal for projects where performance is a priority.
- **Need scalability** – Minestom’s multi-threaded design allows it to handle high player counts efficiently.
- **Are building a custom server experience** – If you're creating a server that doesn’t rely on vanilla Minecraft mechanics, Minestom is a great choice.

Don't use Minestom when you:
- **Want a drop-in replacement for vanilla servers** – Minestom is not a direct replacement for Paper, Spigot, or vanilla Minecraft servers, as it does not include many vanilla mechanics by default.
- **Rely on plugins from Bukkit, Spigot, or Paper** – Minestom has its own API, meaning existing Minecraft server plugins will not work out of the box.
