- title: Introduction
  paragraphs:
    - A complete rewrite of Minecraft server software, <strong>open-source</strong>
      and <strong>without any code from Mojang</strong>.
    - The main difference from default Minecraft is that Minestom does not contain any
      features by default. However, we have a complete API that allows you to make anything
      possible with extensions, similar to how plugins and mods work.
  warn: This is a developer API; It is not meant to be used by the end-users.
  error: Replacing Bukkit/Forge/Sponge with this <strong>will not work</strong> since
    we do not implement any of their APIs.

  code: |
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialization
        MinecraftServer minecraftServer = MinecraftServer.init();

        InstanceManager instanceManager = MinecraftServer.getInstanceManager();
        // Create the instance
        InstanceContainer instanceContainer = instanceManager.createInstanceContainer();
        // Set the ChunkGenerator
        instanceContainer.setChunkGenerator(new GeneratorDemo());

        // Add an event callback to specify the spawning instance (and the spawn position)
        GlobalEventHandler globalEventHandler = MinecraftServer.getGlobalEventHandler();
        globalEventHandler.addListener(PlayerLoginEvent.class, event -> {
            final Player player = event.getPlayer();
            event.setSpawningInstance(instanceContainer);
            player.setRespawnPoint(new Pos(0, 42, 0));
        });

        // Start the server on port 25565
        minecraftServer.start("0.0.0.0", 25565);
    }
- title: Instances
  paragraphs:
    - Worlds in default Minecraft are great for playing with friends, but scaling them
      up can be unmanageable. The best examples of this can be found in minigames; it's
      hard to separate worlds properly and all worlds are saved in files. Plus, there's
      a lot of overhead caused by unnecessary data contained in them.
    - Instances are our lightweight solution to it. You can copy and send them to another
      player in no time, create a serializer, decide if they're saved in memory only,
      and more.
    - Being able to create instances on the go is a must-have that can help push many
      more projects forward.
    - Instances also come with performance benefits. Unlike other implementations of
      worlds that may be fully singlethreaded or use one thread per world, Minestom
      uses a set number of threads (a thread pool) to manage chunks independently from
      instances so that lag can be reduced.

    // Get the instance manager
    InstanceManager instanceManager = MinecraftServer.getInstanceManager();

    // Create the instance
    InstanceContainer instanceContainer = instanceManager.createInstanceContainer();

    // Set the ChunkGenerator
    instanceContainer.setChunkGenerator(/* chunk generator here */);

    // Make chunks automatically load
    instanceContainer.enableAutoChunkLoad(true);
- title: Blocks
  paragraphs:
    - By default, Minestom doesn't know what a chest is. You have to tell the server
      to open an inventory when someone clicks on it. Every one of these special blocks
      (a block that isn't only visual) has to be registered, but after that, they can
      just be placed in the world.
    - However, all blocks are visually there, and you only need to add functionality.

            if (placement instanceof PlayerPlacement) {
                // A player placed the block
            }
            Block block = placement.getBlock();
            System.out.println("The block " + block.name() + " has been placed");
        }

        @Override
        public @NotNull NamespaceID getNamespaceId() {
            // Required for serialization purpose
            return NamespaceID.from("minestom:demo");
        }
    }

    Block tnt = Block.TNT;
    // Create a new block with the specified handler.
    // Be aware that block objects can be reused, handlers should
    // therefore never assume to be assigned to a single block.
    tnt = tnt.withHandler(new DemoHandler());
    // Share the same handler reference with multiple blocks
    BlockHandler handler = new DemoHandler();
    Block stone = Block.STONE.withHandler(handler);
    Block grass = Block.GRASS.withHandler(handler);
- title: Entities
  paragraphs:
    - The terms "passive" or "aggressive" mobs do not exist. Nobody forbids you from
      making a flying chicken that rushes at any players that come too close. Doing
      this with NMS is a mess because of obfuscation and the large inheritance, but
      it's easy with Minestom.

    // Creating a chicken that runs after you
    // but unfortunately does not fly
    final Entity chicken = new Entity(EntityType.CHICKEN);
    chicken.addAIGroup(ImmutableList.of(
                new DoNothingGoal(chicken, 500, 0.1f),
                new MeleeAttackGoal(chicken, 2, 500, TimeUnit.MILLISECOND),
                new RandomStrollGoal(chicken, 4)
            ),
            ImmutableList.of(
                new LastEntityDamagerTarget(chicken, 15),
                new ClosestEntityTarget(chicken, 15, Player.class)
            ));
    final Instance instance = ...; // Instance to spawn the chicken in
    final Pos spawnPosition = new Pos(0, 42, 0);
    chicken.setInstance(instance, spawnPosition);
- title: Inventories
  paragraphs:
    - Inventories have evolved a lot from just being storage containers. They are often
      used as a client&lt;-&gt;server interface with clickable items and callbacks.
      Minestom supports it natively without having to program all the basic stuff yourself!

    // Create the inventory
    Inventory inventory = new Inventory(InventoryType.CHEST_1_ROW, "The inventory name");
    // Open the inventory for the player
    // (Opening the same inventory for multiple players would result in a shared interface)
    player.openInventory(inventory);
    // Close the current player inventory
    player.closeInventory();
- title: Commands
  paragraphs:
    - Commands are the simplest way of communication between clients and server. In
      1.13, Minecraft started using a new library for commands named Brigadier. Minestom
      has integrated an API that allows you to use the features it adds.

            setCondition(Conditions::playerOnly);
            setDefaultExecutor(((sender, args) ->
                sender.sendMessage(Component.text("Usage: /potion <type> <duration (seconds)>")));

            potion = ArgumentType.Potion("potion");
            duration = ArgumentType.Integer("duration");

            addSyntax(this::onPotionCommand, potion, duration);
        }

        private void onPotionCommand(CommandSender sender, CommandContext context) {
            final Player player = (Player) sender;
            final PotionEffect potionEffect = context.get(potion);
            final Integer duration = context.get(this.duration);
            player.sendMessage(Component.text(player.getActiveEffects().toString()));
            player.addEffect(new Potion( potionEffect, (byte) 0, duration * MinecraftServer.TICK_PER_SECOND));
        }
    }
