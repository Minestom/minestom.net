features:
  - title: Instances
    details: Instances are lightweight alternatives to worlds. Minestom uses a a thread pool to manage chunks independently from instances so that lag can be reduced.
  - title: Blocks
    details: By default, Minestom doesn't know what a chest is. You have to tell the server to open an inventory when someone clicks on it. All functionality needs to be created.
  - title: Entities
    details: The terms "passive" or "aggressive" mobs do not exist. Nobody forbids you from making a flying chicken that rushes at any players that come too close.
  - title: Inventories
    details: Inventories have evolved a lot from just being storage containers. Minestom supports inventory callbacks without having to program all the basic stuff yourself!
  - title: Commands
    details: Commands are the simplest way of communication between clients and server. Minestom has integrated an API that allows you to use the features Brigader adds.
  - title: Community
    details: Minestom has a welcoming community that is happy to provide help to anyone in need. Contributions are welcomed and are always appreciated.
