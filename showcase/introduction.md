# Minestom Showcase

## Submitting a Server

To submit a server, create a pull request [here](https://github.com/Minestom/minestom.net). First, add your server markdown file under the `/showcase` directory. To store media, upload it to the `/public/showcase/(server)` directory. To use the images, use `![Image Alt](/showcase/(server)/(image)` in your markdown. Finally, to add the route to the sidebar, edit `themeConfig.sidebar."/showcase"`, in `/.vitepress/config.mts`. An example can be seen in the config.
