# Minestom Server Showcase

Here you can find other servers or submit a server for showcase.

## Submitting a Server

### Requirements

- Must be using Minestom (obviously)
- Must be publicly available for review.

### Submitting a server

1. First, fork the website repository [here](https://github.com/Minestom/minestom.net).
2. Next, add your server markdown file under the `/showcase` directory. To store media, upload it to the `/public/showcase/(server)` directory. To use the images, use `![Image Alt](/showcase/(server)/(image)` in your markdown.
3. To add the server to the sidebar, edit `themeConfig.sidebar./showcase`, in `/.vitepress/config.mts`. An example can be seen in the config.
4. Finally, commit & push your changes and make a pull request!
5. Wait for someone to review the PR and make any changes/updates.
