# Introduction

::: info
Please note that it may take up to an hour after adding the `minestom-implementation` or `minestom-library` topics for the implementation/library to show up in this list.
:::

## Implementations

These projects extend Minestom in order to include more functionalities. Some of the projects can be used as-is, but other might require you to further extend it to be usable.

Note that the WIP state is determined automatically based on releases, if your implementation is production ready be sure to create a release for it.

To submit your implementation, simply add the minestom-implementation topic to your repository on GitHub.

## Libraries

Libraries can be used to share code between multiple projects.
Here you can find public libraries, official ones are highlighted with orange; work-in-progress libraries are opaque.

Note that the WIP state is determined automatically based on releases, if your library is production ready be sure to create a release for it.

To submit your library, simply add the minestom-library topic to your repository on GitHub.
